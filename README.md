A little side project I decided to take on. The bot takes in a max of two years worth of stock data for the tickers you specify, and answers the prompt based on that.
The model is not trained or finetuned, it just gives inferences on the data based on the prompt. Sometimes, it doesn't provide the most coherent suggestions since I'm using a
open source quantized Gemma 2 model due to memory concerns.
